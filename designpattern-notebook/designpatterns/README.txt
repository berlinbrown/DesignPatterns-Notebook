 Use of NANOHTTPD
 ======================================

 Why another Java HTTPD?
 Couldn't find a small enough, embeddable and easily modifiable HTTP server that I could just 
 copy and paste into my other Java projects. Every one of them consisted of dozens of .java files 
 and/or jars, usually with - from my point of view - "overkill features" like servlet support, 
 web administration, configuration files, logging etc.
